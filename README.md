# Senior Project

by Paola and Brandon


Banked Curves Simulation

FEATURES:
-free body diagram of forces acting on the cart
-adjustable track radius, track slope angle, frictional coefficient, car velocity, gravity, and car mass

TO ADD:
-more equations to aid in student comprehension
-possible camera movement for animation
-more accurate fbd for friction coefficient effects
-signal for when the car will slip?

Todo:

Add buttons for different camera, environment modes
Skybox?
Actual (random?) environments and other elements (buildings? trees?)
Add arrows for MAX friction (caps at current friction) and ACTUAL force (sum of gravity, FN, max friction)
Clarify that orange friction is NEEDED friction for centripetal motion
Work on math UI and display values of FG, FN, Ffs, Max Ffs, Fcp, FReal
Better Car Design
Smooth Texture for Track
Texture for outside of track
Host textures?
Textures for car, environment objects, etc
Skateboard for urban setting?
